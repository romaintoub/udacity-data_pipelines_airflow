# Data Pipelines with Airflow

Sparkify is a music streaming app. The analytics team has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

**Goal** 
Build high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. The data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and data quality checks have been created to run tests against the datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.

## Database

Two datasets are used to build the tables :
### **Song Dataset**
Songs dataset is a subset of [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).

Sample Record :
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### **Log Dataset**
Logs dataset is generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim).

Sample Record :
```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```

## **Project files**

```sql_queries.py``` : This script contains SQL queries in order to drop, create and insert tables.

```create_tables.py``` : This script contains functions for setting up database. Running this file creates **sparkifydb** database, drop the tables if they already exist and create new tables from ```sql_queries.py```. 

```etl.py``` : This script is the automation process of ```etl.ipynb```, it reads and loads **song_data** and **log_data**.

## 2. Database schema design and ETL pipeline

The project is divided into 3 important steps :
- Create tables with a star schema 
- Building ETL processes 
- Building ETL pipe


1. Create tables with a star schema 

![Sparkify Schema](./images/sparkify_schema.jpg)

The project is composed of one fact table and four dimension tables. The fact table, named _songplays_, records in log data associated with song plays. This table provides the metrics of the data I want to extract. The dimension tables provide information related to different dimensions of the fact table, such as _users_, _songs_, _artists_ and _time_ which records respectively the users, the songs, the artists and the timestamp of records in _songplays_ broken down into different units. 

So the create tables, multiple CREATE statements have been written in sql_queries.py and called into create_tables.py. In order to be able to reset the database, DROP statements have been created for all the tables. When running create_tables.py, I make sure that all the tables are dropped and then recreated from scratch and empty after connecting to sparkify database.  I can see in the _songplays_ tables that the unique primary key for each dimension table is included in the fact table. 

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

#### Fact Table

songplays - records in event data associated with song plays.

    songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables 

##### users

    user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
##### songs

    song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

##### artists

    artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

##### time

    start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

2. Building ETL processes 

In order to test the data from *Song* and *Log* *datasets*, I run some test on etl.ipynb notebook. In this notebook, all the files from both datasets are extracted and processed to be then inserted into the right table. As the datasets are json files, they are loaded with pandas package and processed as a DataFrame to a list to be inserted via execution of a query through Postgres._songs_ and _artists_ tables are filled from *Song* *dataset* and _time_ and _users_ table are completed with *Log* *dataset*. In order to fill in _songplays_ table, both datasets are needed and to get the song ID and artist ID, I needed to query the songs and artists tables to find matches based on song title, artist name, and song duration time. During the whole exercice on this notebook, a connection was created to communicate with Sparkify database and then closed before ending the jupyter notebook. Next, to explore the database, a few lines of SELECT queries are tested into test.ipynb to see if the data is actually filled with etl.ipynb.
